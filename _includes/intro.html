                    The main objective of my group is to augment our understanding on the molecular mechanisms 
                    that underlie and control vital cellular functions. We approach this challenge by deciphering 
                    the dynamic interplay between the function and spatiotemporal localization of biomolecules 
                    (virus, dug nanocarrier, oligonucleotides or protein assemblies) and how this correlate 
                    to cellular and organismal response. <br><br>
                    We have therefore pioneered the development of novel new imaging technologies - with an 
                    emphasis on single particle and live cell microscopy - that promises to shed light on
                    the interplays between the behaviour (dynamics, function and localisation) of biomolecules 
                    and high throughput single particle screening methodologies to decipher oligonucleotide 
                    interactions with membranes. By tracking the spatiotemporal displacement and localization
                    of one protein - or an assembly - in real time we revealed internalization pathways and 
                    cell fate of nanoparticles and viruses. Our functional and FRET studies at the fundamental 
                    limit of individual catalytic cycle, on the other hand have helped deciphering protein
                    structure and function dependence on temporal cell localization and the design of novel 
                    ligand biasing aberrant biological function. <br><br>
                    Recognizing that 4D imaging generates terabytes of data sets, that are prohibitively 
                    hard to be quantitatively
                    evaluated by current semi-manual analysis, we have developed toolboxes
                     and softwares based on machine learning
                    to rapidly, reliably and free of human cognitive biases, analyze the wealth of novel 
                    microscopy data we, 
                    and others, produce. Our all-inclusive softwares for windows and macs, offer transition
                     from raw data to
                    quantitative analysis and data classification with less than 5 clicks, accelerating the 
                    automatic analysis by ~6 orders of magnitude. These combined methodologies bridge 4D imaging 
                    with sophisticate image analysis required for delving into the era of 4D cell and tissue imaging.
